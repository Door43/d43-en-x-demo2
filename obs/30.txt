Many people recognized Jesus and saw him leave.  The people left their towns and ran to where He would land.  When Jesus arrived, he saw a large crowd of people.

The crowd was huge - 5,000 people not counting women and children. He felt sorry for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd.** He began teaching them many things and healing the sick ones among them.

As evening approached his close followers came to him and said, this is a desert; there is no food nearby; send them to town so they can buy food for themselves.

Then Jesus divided the loves and fishes. His close followers then gave the food to the people and they all ate until they were full.

After everyone finished eating, Jesus' close followers picked up the left over fish and bread. It filled up twelve baskets.

**Sheep without a shepherd: Sheep need attentive care and protection. Without a shepherd they can separate and fall prey to wolves.
