So the man answered and said," You should love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind and every other part of your being and love the people around you as you love yourself." Jesus replied "You are correct, do all of this and you will live forever."

But the man, trying to argue his case, asked, " Do you really mean I have to love everyone?"

Then a Samaritan, a man from a place hated by the Jews, came along. He saw the man and showed him compassion. He cleaned his wounds and bandaged them.

He transported him on his own animal and took him to the nearest hotel. There he took care of him.

The next day he gave the hotel manager more than enough money to pay for the mans care and the room. He also said, " If you need to spend more money for his care I will pay you when I come back."

Jesus then asked this question, " Who of these three men actually showed love to the man who was attacked?" The man replied, "The person who helped him." So Jesus replied, " You should do the same. "
