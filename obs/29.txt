Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him "How many times should I let my friend off the hook when he does something bad to me? Is seven times enough?" Jesus replied," Not seven times but as often as it happens."

So Jesus told him, "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who decided to make his servants pay back their debts. The first servant who was brought to the master owed him millions of dollars."

And when it was discovered that he could not pay the debt, everything he had was ordered to be sold, including himself, his wife and his children, to pay the debt.

The servant fell to his knees and begged the king, "Give me time and I will repay everything." The king had mercy and canceled the debt, and the servant left as a free man.

Then that servant went out and found another servant who owed him one hundred pennies. He choked him and demanded him to repay all that he owed him.

But his fellow servant begged on his knees, "Give me enough time and I will pay back everything I owe." But the servent would not do it; instead he had his fellow servent thrown into prison until the debt was paid.

When his friends saw what happened, they went to the master and told him about it because they were heartbroken about it.

And his master called him and said, "You wicked servent! Did I not cancel all of your debt just because you asked me too? Should you not have had the same mercy on your fellow servent?" And the master was very angry and sent the servent away to be tortured until all his debt was paid.

So Jesus said "My Father in heaven will do exactly this to everyone who is unwilling to love his brother as he should."
