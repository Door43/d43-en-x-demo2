So Jesus told him, "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who brought his servants to pay back their debts. The first servent brought to the master owed him millions of dollars."

And when he was found unable to pay the debt, everything he had was ordered to the debt.

The servent, on his knees, begged the king, "Give me time to pay the debt." The king had mercy and canceled the debt. And the servent left.

And his even-servant fell down, and prayed him, and said, Have patience in me, and I shall requite all things to thee. But he would not; but went out, and put him into prison, till he had paid all the debt.

And his even-servants, seeing the things that were done, were sorrowed greatly. And they came, and told to their lord all the things that were done.

Then his lord called him, and said to him, Wicked servant, I forgave to thee all the debt, for thou prayedest me. Therefore whether it behooved not also thee to have mercy on thine even-servant, as I had mercy on thee? And his lord was wroth, and betook him to tormentors, till he had paid all the debt.

So my Father of heaven shall do to you, if ye forgive not every man to his brother, of your hearts.
