Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him "How many times should I cancel the debt when my brother sins against me? Is seven times enough?" Jesus replied," Not seven times but seventy times seven, or as often as it happens."

So Jesus told him, "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who brought his servants to pay back their debts. The first servent brought to the master owed him millions of dollars."

And when he was found unable to pay the debt, everything he had was ordered to the debt.

The servent, on his knees, begged the king, "Give me time to pay the debt." The king had mercy and canceled the debt. And the servent left.

Then that servant went out and found his fellow servent who owed him one hundred pennies. He choked him and demanded him to repay all that he owed him.

But his fellow servant begged on his knees, "Give me enough time and I will pay back everything I owe." But the servent would not do it; instead he had his fellow servent thrown into prison until the debt was paid.

When his peers saw what happened, they went to the master and told him about it because they were heartbroken about it.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-29-08.jpg}}

And his master called him and said, "You wicked servent! Did I not cancel all of your debt just because you asked me too? Should you not have had the same mercy on your fellow servent?" And the master was very angry and sent the servent away to be tortured until all his debt was paid.

The Father in heaven will do exactly this to everyone who is unwilling to love his brother as he should.
