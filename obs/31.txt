But between three and six in the morning, He walked to them on the surface of the sea. They saw Jesus walking on the sea as he got close to the boat.

Those in the boat saw Jesus walking on the water and were terrified and frightened. They said it is a ghost, then  Jesus said, "It is I, have faith and believe. Do not fear."
