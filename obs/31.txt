Immediately, Jesus told his helpers to get in the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side. He went up on the top of a hill alone to pray. He prayed there until late at night.

The waves were very high around the boat. The followers of Jesus were having a hard time rowing the boat because the strong winds were working against them.

But between three and six in the morning, He walked to them on the surface of the sea. They saw Jesus walking on the sea as he got close to the boat.

Those in the boat saw Jesus walking on the water and were terrified and frightened. They said it is a ghost, then  Jesus said, "It is I, have faith and believe. Do not fear."

And Peter, thinking it was Jesus on the water, said to Jesus, "if it is you, command me to come to you on the water and I will come". And Jesus did say to him come on the water.

And Peter got out of the boat and walked to Jesus on the surface of the sea. When he saw how strong the wind was and the waves, he looked away from Jesus.

And he was afraid, and when he began to drown, he cried out, "Lord, save me!" Jesus immediately reached out his hand and pulled him out, and said to him, "You have very little faith. Why did you doubt?"

And when they had ascended into the boat, the wind ceased. And they, that were in the boat, came, and worshipped him, and said, Verily, thou art God's Son.
