Immediately, Jesus told his helpers to get in the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side. He went up on the top of a hill alone to pray. He prayed there until late at night.

The waves were very high around the boat. The followers of Jesus were having a hard time rowing the boat because the strong winds were working against them.

But between three and six in the morning, He walked to them on the surface of the sea. They saw Jesus walking on the sea as he got close to the boat.

Those in the boat saw Jesus walking on the water and were terrified and frightened. They said it is a ghost, then  Jesus said, "It is I, have faith and believe. Do not fear."

Peter said to Jesus, "If it is really you, tell me to come to you on the water and I will come." So Jesus said to him, "Come on."

Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to Jesus. When he saw how strong the wind and the waves were, he took his eyes off of Jesus.

And he was afraid, and when he began to drown, he yelled, "Lord, save me!" Jesus immediately reached out his hand and pulled him up, and said to him, "You have very little faith. Why don't you trust me??"

And when they got into the boat, the wind calmed down. Those who were in the boat , kneeled down in awe of him, saying "You really are the Son of God!!!4"
