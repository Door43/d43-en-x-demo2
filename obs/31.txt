Immediately, Jesus told his helpers to get in the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side. He went up on the top of a hill to pray. He prayed there until late at night and he was alone.

Meanwhile, the followers of Jesus were having a hard time rowing the boat because the strong winds were working against them and the sea was rough.

Just before dawn, Jesus walked to them on the surface of the sea. They saw Him walking on the water as he got close to the boat.

Those in the boat saw Jesus walking on the water and were terrified and frightened. They thought He was a ghost, but Jesus said, "It is I, trust me. Don't be afraid."

Peter said to Jesus, "If it is really you, tell me to come to you on the water and I will come." So Jesus said to him, "Come on."

Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to Jesus. When he saw how strong the wind was and the waves, he looked away from Jesus.

And he was afraid, and when he began to drown, he cried out, "Lord, save me!" Jesus immediately reached out his hand and pulled him out, and said to him, "You have very little faith. Why did you doubt?"

And when they got into the boat, the wind calmed down. Those who were in the boat came to him, praising and honoring him, saying "You truly are the Son of God."
