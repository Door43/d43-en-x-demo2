John continued by saying "Children of snakes! do good things worthy of your change, because like any tree that doesn't produce good fruit, it will be cut down and thrown into the fire." John fulfills what the prophets said: Look, I will send a messenger to prepare your way.

When all the people guessed, and all men thought in their hearts of John, lest peradventure he were Christ, John answered and said to all men, A stronger than I shall come after me, and I am not worthy to kneel down, and unloose his shoes.

And John forbade him, and said, I owe to be baptized of thee, and thou comest to me? But Jesus answered, and said to him, Suffer now, for thus it falleth to us to fulfill all right wiseness. And Jesus was baptized by him.

And when Jesus was baptized, at once he went up from the water; and lo! heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down as a dove, and coming on him; and lo! a voice from heaven, saying, This is my loved Son, in which I have well pleased to me.

God had told John, On whom thou seest the Spirit coming down, and dwelling on him, this is he, that is the Son of God.
