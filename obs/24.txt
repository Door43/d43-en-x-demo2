God spoke to John, whose parents were Zacharias and Elizabeth. John wore clothes made of camel's hair and shorts made of animal skin. He ate large hopping insects with wings and free-range honey for food.

Everybody in the region of Judea and in the city of Jerusalem went out to see him in the Judean desert. He told them: "Repent from sin, because the kingdom of heavens (God's realm of authority) is coming soon!"

Many people that heard John's message were washed by him in Jordan river, admitting their sins.

John continued by saying "Children of snakes! Do good things worthy of your change, because like any tree that doesn't produce good fruit, it will be cut down and thrown into the fire." John was fulfilling what the prophet Isaiah predicted: Look, I will send my messenger ahead of you to prepare your way.

When the people were wondering whether John was the Christ, John said to them "Someone much more important than me will come, and I am less worthy than a slave to even untie his sandals."

On another day, John saw Jesus coming to be dunked and said, "Look, the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world!"

And John refused, saying, "You're the one that should be washing me (in the Jordan), but you're asking me to do it?" But Jesus answered, "Let's do it this way, because this is our responsibility to do the right thing." And John washed Jesus in the Jordan.

When Jesus came out of the water, the sky opened up, and the Spirit of God came down as if it were a dove, and landed on him. And the voice from heaven said "This is the son I love, who makes me very happy."

God had told John before, "Whomever you see the spirit of God come down upon, that is him; that is the Son of God."
