And Jesus was teaching by the sea and there was a great crowd gathered.  There were so many that he went out on a boat, and the crowd was listening to him from the shore.

He spoke using a story. "A farmer went to plant his crop. Some of the seed fell on a path and people walked over it. The birds also ate the seeds.

Some of the seed fell on rocky soil and when the sun came out, these seeds were dried up and died becaused they had no depth with their roots.

Some of the seeds fell among the thorns and bushes. Their growth was choked off and they did not produce fruit.

And others fell on good ground and produced much fruit. Some produced thirty, some sixty and some a hundred. And he said those who have ears to hear, let them hear."

His disciples asked him about the meaning of the parable. Jesus said "the seed is the Word and those on the side are the believers that Satan has taken the word from their hearts so they would not believe.

Those that fall on the rocky soil receive God's word with joy but never grow any roots. So they believe for a while, but because of temptation, fall away.

The seed that fell among the thorns are those who heard God's word, and responded for a time. But then later were choked by the cares of the world, and the desires for riches. They bring forth no fruit.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-33-09.jpg?direct&}}

The seed that fell on good ground, after hearing God's word, kept it in their hearts, and patiently bring forth good fruit."
