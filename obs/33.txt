And Jesus was teaching by the sea and there was a great crowd gathered.  There were so many that he went out on a boat, and the crowd was listening to him from the shore.

He spoke using a story.  "A farmer went to plant his crop.  Some of the seed fell on a path and people walked over it.  The birds also ate the seeds.

Some of the seed fell on rocky soil and when the sun came out, these seeds were dried up and died becaused they had no depth with their roots.

Some of the seeds fell among the thorns and bushes.  their growth was choked off and they did not produce fruit.

And others fell on good ground and produced much fruit.  Some produced thirty, some sixty and some a hundred.  And he said those who have ears to hear, let them hear."

His disciples asked him about the meaning of the parable.  Jesus said "the seed is the Word and those on the side are the believers that satan has taken the word  from their hearts so they would not believe".

Those on the rock hear the word and believe for a short time, but fall away after a time because they have no root and they are tempted.

Those that fall amoung the thorns have heard the word go forward, but they are slowley hindered from moving forward because of the riches and distractions of the world.

Those sown on good ground quickly have deep roots and are solidly founded in the word.
