Peter said to Jesus "Master it's good that we are here, we should make three tents: One for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." Peter did not know what to say.

While Peter was still speaking a bright cloud appeared over them. A voice from the cloud said "This is my son that I love, and I am pleased with Him. Listen to Him". When Peter, John and James heard the voice they fell down and were very afraid.

And Jesus came to them and touched them. He said to them "Don't be afraid". And when they looked up they didn't see anyone but Jesus.

While they were coming down the mountain Jesus instructed them not to tell anyone what they had seen until God had raised the Son of man from the dead.
