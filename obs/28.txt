A governmant official came to Jesus and said "good teacher, what can I do to go to heaven." Why do you call me good?  No one is good. Only God is perfectly good. If you want to go to heaven, then obey all of  Gods laws."

He asked "which laws?"  Jesus said: don't kill anybody; don't sleep with anyone who is not your spouse; and don't lie; and respect you parents. Care about the people around you as you would care about yourself.

And the offical answered Jesus, I have obeyed these laws since I was a little kid. Then Jesus had compasion for him.

Then Jesus said to him, if you want to be perfect, then do this. Go sell all you have, give it to the poor, and you will have a reward in heaven. Then come follow me.

But when the young offical heard what Jesus said and he went away sad, because he had a lot of stuff!

Then Jesus said to him,  let me tell you like it is; not many rich people can go to heaven. It's like the impossibility of squeezing a large camel through a small needle hole.

Then Jesus's followers were blown away, saying "Who can be saved then?"

Then Jesus looked at them and said " With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible"

Then peter said "We left everything and followed you. So what do we get?"



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-28-10.jpg}}

Jesus said "Everyone who has left houses, borthers, sisters, fathers, mothers, or suff for me will recieve 100 times more and live forever. Many people who are first will be last and those that are last will be first.
