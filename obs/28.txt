A governmant official came to Jesus and said "good teacher, what can I do to go to heaven." Why do you call me good?  No one is good. Only God is perfectly good. If you want to go to heaven, then obey all of  Gods laws."

He asked "which laws?"  Jesus said: don't kill anybody; don't sleep with anyone who is not your spouse; and don't lie; and respect you parents. Care about the people around you as would care about yourself.

And the offical answered Jesus, I have obeyed these laws since I was a little kid. Then Jesus had compasion for him.

The Jesus said to him, if you want to be perfect, then do this. Go sell all you have and give it to the poor. Then come follow me.

The young offical, heard what Jesus said and he wnt away sad, because he had a lot of stuff!

Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-28-10.jpg}}

And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
